# Hi! I'm Mustansir what's up
### Welcome to my github, it's sorta boring here but I'm working on it for sureeeee

### About me
I'm a second year cyber security student at Shah and Anchor Kutchhi Engineering College in Mumbai, I've got some experience on the terminal playing hackthebox and tryhackme but always want to do IT security management. The CISSP is a long way from where I am but as of now I'm just enjoying myself learning python. It's fun for sure, I type pseudocode and the thing just works out it's always hilarious. 

Other than work I enjoy talking about philosophy, psychology and lots and lots of American television. I love listening to music from Can't help falling in love to Beqarar karke hame yum na jaiye I love it all. I also love learning and cleaning. 

### What am I good at?
**Python** and when I say python I mean I'm good at software design in python. Don't be fooled by the code on this repo, most of the project in the works are much better designed with proper CI/CD implementations and well written tests. Plus github actions is ngl pretty cool. I'm always looking for neat ways to write more fluid python code and documentation methods. 

My projects tend to circle around basic cybersecurity headaches and trying to automate solutions. Writing scalable and flexible code is a dream of mine, and implementing good coding practices I feel is a way to go in doing that. 

Not to mention I'm pretty good at hacking, if not good atleast pretty crafty. Obviously I've played around significantly with Nmap, Nikto, Gobuster, Burpsuite and Metasploit to name the more mainstream tools. Other than this I've had my headaches in circumventing web application security practices like bruteforce, http-auth and file upload. I'm in the top 1% on tryhackme which while in itself is not a feat I believe getting there in a week or two is. It's alot easier after spending a couple of months on hackthebox figuring the stuff out yourself. I've made a couple of websites in django and flask to get a better look at how to setup email, apache, nginx(for my dark web store) as reverse proxies and what not to study how a developer looks at his code in the backend. Production always effin turns out badðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£. 

## Ask me about
Reach out whether it's about cybersecurity, linux, internships or python. I'd love to help. I have experience with tensorflow, pytorch and scipy.

## Ongoing projects
1. RST 
- The reverse shell tool is an all-in-one shell tool maker. It uses python on the cli to make a reverse shell in 5 different languages and paste it into your clipboard. What's more is that is automatically starts the listener for you and allows you to switch the shell you've created to a more customized one or even to a different language all while using the same reverse shell.

1. 
```bash
pip3 install reverse-shell-tool
```
2. 
```bash
rst -h
```

2. Py Project Structure
- A simple template repository containing the appropriate structure for a python package that goes on python packaging index with pytest and github actions setup. I've also setup precommit hooks. Use this repo as a template for beginners in python 
- It also shows how to setup the docs directory and the github workflow for a readthedocs.io workflow to auto generate a new build.
